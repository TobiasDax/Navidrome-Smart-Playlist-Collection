# Navidrome-Smart-Playlist-Collection
This is a Collection of my navidrome smart playlists  
it contains multiple nested smart playlists that reference each other and are curated to my specific taste. Feel free to use this as an inspiration for your own smart playlists.
### Caution
the smart playlists work via IDs, those will not be the same for you so every playlist has go be fixed by hand.

## Different Playlist Types
i have a few Playlist that are used as base lines for my other Smart Playlists, these can be found at the Bottom of the list but it might make sense to start the explanation with these.  
all Playlists start with a number code to sort and differentiate them.


### 09 - Genre Playlists
these might seem stupid but i like habibg official Gebre Tags on my music. But these official Tags result in a huge amount of subgenres that are not always managable in other nested playlists.   
Therefore i have these 12 Genre Playlists that sort artists into broad genres as i see fit.   
ithese are sometimes more like my own feeling rather than a source of truth, but the have been a lot of work to create and work for me.

### 99 - Weight Playlists
These are Smart Playlist that provide a ratibg based amount of songs  
- 5 stars: Music i never want to skip, all 5 Star songs are in here, allways  
- 4 Stars: songs i like a lot but might skip if i hear them to often in a short amount of time. So they are linited to 300 tracks and randomly rotated through. They also ihbore tracks that have been skipped in the last few days.  
- 3 Stars: the bulk of my music. nice to listen to in the background but not my favorites. 150 tracks, longer ban after skip.  
- 2 Stars: Don't really like that stuff but its part of an album and i might want to broaden my horizon once in a while. 50 Songs, longer skip ban  
- 1 Star: i really hate that track. never pop up anywhere. is only a smart playlist to provide the option to use, but is not used anywhere.

### 00 - Favorites
these playlists use the 99 Weights to create a playlist with only the best tracks and a bigger one with a few songs i might not like that much to break out of the bubble.  
These two playlists are what i play most of the tine and they are offline synced to my phone.

### 99 - Sort Playlists
Two playlists per 09 Genre Playlist to provide a weight based approach to genres.  
- 50 Tracks in the three star playlist  
- 150 Tracks in the 4 and 4 Star playlist

### 07 - Genre Selections
these playlist combine the two 99 Sort Playlists per gebre to give a nice, enjoyable way to focus on one music genre.

### 08 - Unsorted
buckets for the artists/ tracks i have not sorted into genres or rated yet.

### 01 - 06
these spaces are kept for manual playlists, sorted by hand
